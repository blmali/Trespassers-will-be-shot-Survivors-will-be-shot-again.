For example, a player who prefers long range attack and strategic positioning in gameplay is a sniping class of play.   In order to classify a person into a specific class of play, we have 10 recorded 10 such features of the player. Some of these features are the average number of time the player killed an enemy in the same house (which may indicate rushing into the enemy team or dissolving a rush),  average kills by player played with other 3 teammates killed in squad match, etc.  Your task is to classify the players into 1 out of 7 class of play, given the 10 features with each player.
